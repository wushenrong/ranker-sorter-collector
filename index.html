    <h1>Ranker Sorter</h1>
    <p>
      A yet another ranker that uses the ELO Rating System, famous in the world
      of chess to rate the skills of players in a zero-sum game.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h2>Why rank things using ELO?</h2>
      <p>
        Well popularity and favorites is like a zero-sum game as something or
        someone is competing how much time you will give focus to them as time
        is a limited resource. So why not try to quantify that as a ranking.
      </p>
